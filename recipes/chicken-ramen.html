        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
            Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. 
            Add onion and saute until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. 
            Add garlic and ginger; cook about 30 seconds more. 
            Add rice vinegar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, mirin, fish sauce, and sriracha sauce; stir to combine. 
            Add chicken broth and water and bring to a boil. 
            Reduce heat and simmer about 5 minutes. 
            Add chicken and bok choy; simmer gently until bok choy is just tender, about 2 minutes.
            </li>
            
            <li>
            Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. 
            Add ramen noodles and return to a boil. 
            Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 5 to 7 minutes. 
            Drain and drizzle with vegetable oil to prevent sticking.
            </li>

            <li>
            While ramen is cooking, fill a pot with enough water to cover the eggs and bring to a boil. 
            Gently lower eggs into the boiling water and cook until yolks are barely set, about 7 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
            Fill a large bowl with ice water. 
            Transfer soft boiled eggs to the ice bath to stop the cooking process; let sit about 3 minutes. 
            Drain eggs, carefully peel away shells, and slice in half.
            </li>

            <li>
            Divide ramen between 4 bowls. 
            Add broth. 
            Top each with jalapeno, green onions, cilantro, and soft boiled egg. 
            Serve immediately.
            </li>
        
        </ol>

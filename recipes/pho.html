        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            This recipe will result in a tasty Vietnamese dish known as Pho.
            The food comprises of rice noodles within a meat broth alongside the meat itself,
            with herbs added afterwards before being served.
            The recipients have the choice of adding sriracha sauce to liven up the flavour.

            Remember to set some time to cook the food, because it <em>will</em> take awhile.
            Once you are done, however, everyone will be sure to enjoy your food!

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            A must-have for all meat lovers! The recipe features marinated chicken, grilled and served with <strong>lemongrass</strong>.
            My personal favourite way to eat this is to have it with pho.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped lemongrass</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons light brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fish sauce</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds chicken thighs, or more to taste, pounded to an even thickness</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>
                Mix canola oil, lemongrass, lemon juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, 
                and fish sauce together in a mixing bowl until the sugar is dissolved; 
                add chicken and turn to coat in the marinade.
            </li>

            <li>
                Marinate chicken in the refrigerator for 20 minutes to 1 hour.
            </li>

            <li>
                Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
            </li>

            <li>
                Remove chicken thighs from the marinade and shake to remove excess marinade. Discard the remaining marinade.
            </li>

            <li>
                Grill chicken until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 3 to 5 minutes per side. 
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
            </li>
            
        </ol>
